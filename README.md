# Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction-for-an-Airline-Company
Customer Satisfaction Prediction for an Airline Company | Analyzing customer feedback and predicting satisfaction using machine learning models. Random Forest achieved 96.27% accuracy.


Project Overview

This project aims to predict airline customer satisfaction using machine learning techniques. We analyze a dataset of 103,904 records with 24 features, split into 80% training and 20% testing data. Our best-performing model, Random Forest Classifier, achieved an accuracy of 96.27%.


Key Findings

1) Only 43.3% of passengers were satisfied with their airline experience.
2) Economy class showed the lowest satisfaction rates.
3) Average arrival delay: 15.13 minutes; average departure delay: 14.18 minutes.
4) Low-rated services include online booking, gate location, in-flight WiFi, food & drinks, and cleanliness.
5)53.85% of passengers found flight timing inconvenient.
